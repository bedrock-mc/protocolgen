// PositionTrackingDBServerBroadcast is sent by the server in response to the PositionTrackingDBClientRequest
// packet. This packet is, as of 1.16, currently only used for lodestones. The server maintains a database
// with tracking IDs and their position and dimension. The client will request these tracking IDs, (NBT tag
// set on the lodestone compass with the tracking ID?) and the server will respond with the status of those
// tracking IDs. What is actually done with the data sent depends on what the client chooses to do with it.
// For the lodestone compass, it is used to make the compass point towards lodestones and to make it spin if
// the lodestone at a position is no longer there.

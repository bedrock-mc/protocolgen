# `valentine_gen`

This retained Axolotl reference generates the Bedrock protocol crates consumed
by `valentine` from Mojang's official `bedrock-protocol-docs` or Endstone. The
PrismarineJS `minecraft-data` frontend, gameplay data generation,
`src/data_generator`, and their submodules are intentionally excluded from
the protocolgen lift; Axolotl owns those paths. `protocolgen` v2 is the
canonical downstream manifest pipeline, while this crate remains an external
regeneration/parity gate.

## Setup and sources

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Mojang generation is selected explicitly and requires a scratch output
directory, so it cannot overwrite the checked-in version crates:

```bash
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- \
  --source mojang --versions 1.26.40 --proto \
  --output-dir C:/tmp/valentine-mojang \
  --emit-wire-manifest C:/tmp/valentine-2168-wire.json
```

`--emit-wire-manifest <FILE>` requires one selected version and writes a stable,
machine-readable view of the lowered IR. Each packet contains its ordered wire
operations with references and nested containers recursively expanded. Primitive
operations stay primitive; arrays record their count prefix, options record the
Bool presence boundary, unions record their control codec and per-value payload,
and recursive references become explicit cycle markers. This makes conformance
comparison independent of generated Rust syntax and is suitable for a future CI
gate.

`--mojang-docs <DIR>` selects any other docs checkout without changing the
submodule pin. For example, maintainers can inspect Mojang main/protocol 2169 in
a scratch checkout while the repository remains pinned to the live-server 2168
target. `--overrides <DIR>` similarly selects an alternate correction set.

## Mojang version mapping and pin policy

The `bedrock-protocol-docs` gitlink is
`0e00fe80f4f3c71572ff6429de40146d1f4412fc` (`automated/1.26.40`). Its schemas
stamp `x-minecraft-version: 1.26.40-beta.0` and `x-protocol-version: 2168`;
Valentine normalizes the prerelease metadata suffix to crate/module version
`v1_26_40` while retaining protocol 2168.

This is intentionally not Mojang main/`r/26_u4` (1.26.50/protocol 2169).
Cinnabar is a client and must advertise the protocol accepted by live 1.26.40
servers. A 1.26.40 server rejects RequestNetworkSettings advertising 2169, and
using the newer layouts would also misparse TextData and persona animated
texture enums. Cinnabar's preceding target is protocol 1001, verified against
live BDS 1.26.32.2; protocol 2168 is its next interoperable target. Both
independent hand-written implementations used as oracles—gophertunnel and
Cloudburst—implement 2168, while neither implements 2169.

Ignoring version/format stamp lines, 968 of 971 JSON schemas are identical
between this pin and main. The complete known 2168-to-2169 wire delta is:

- `RequestNetworkSettingsPacketPayload.json`: protocol constant 2168 becomes
  2169.
- `TextDataPayload.json`: 2169 adds `LineGapHeight` (`F32LE`) at ordinal 4 and
  shifts the following field.
- `persona__AnimatedTextureType.json`: 2169 adds a leading `None`, shifting all
  following discriminants by one.

Main also has `__protocoldoc.json`; this pin does not need it because its corpus
has zero dangling references.

## Mojang corrections and conformance

`overrides/bpd-fixer.json` and `overrides/enum-ordinals.json` are applied in
memory before lowering. Every operation is fail-closed and carries a `why`
citing the protocol 2168 gophertunnel or Cloudburst source used to establish
the correction. The 186 string-enum occurrences have explicit values; the
generator never infers missing wire ordinals. Field-level `Enum-as-Value`
metadata supplies the contextual scalar codec, including Compression, while
the referenced enum supplies its members.

Compression is normally signed zig-zag for signed integer types and ordinary
varint for unsigned types. Eight-bit fields are deliberately not trusted to
that mechanical rule: all 24 ambiguous occurrences in this corpus are pinned
individually to their protocol 2168 oracle codec. See
[`MOJANG_PARITY.md`](MOJANG_PARITY.md) for the evidence table and the
gophertunnel/Cloudburst conformance inventory.

Mojang fixed-width numerics are little-endian unless marked `Big Endian`.
`No size compression` arrays use `U32LE` lengths, and equal `minItems` and
`maxItems` become fixed arrays. Mojang's global CompoundTag hash
`3172631924` maps to Valentine's network little-endian NBT primitive.

## Endstone corrections

`overrides-endstone/` is the correction set for the Endstone dumps and is
expected to stay small: that corpus is extracted from a running server, so a
needed correction usually means the dumper is wrong and is worth reporting
upstream. The corrections are applied over `packets/`, `types/` and `enums/`
together, keyed `<directory>/<document name>`, because a shared type such as the
item `User Data Buffer` is described once under `types/` and reached by every
packet that embeds it.

The one systematic correction is binary buffers. BDS declares a byte buffer as a
C++ `std::string`, which has no encoding guarantee, and the dumper reports that
faithfully as `string`. Valentine decodes strings lossily for gophertunnel
parity, so a `String` turns every non-UTF-8 byte into U+FFFD and re-encodes it as
`EF BF BD`. Encode and decode corrupt symmetrically, so a value round-trip still
passes while the wire is wrong. `overrides-endstone/binary-buffers.json` retypes
each such field as `uint8` with a `uvarint32` repeat prefix, which is byte-for-
byte the same framing and matches gophertunnel's `io.ByteSlice`. Fields that
genuinely carry text stay strings; the file lists both sets with citations.

Corrections against this corpus use `patch_field`, which edits one entry of a
document's `fields` array in place. Mojang's `patch_property` cannot reach them
(these documents use an ordered array, not a `properties` map), and restating a
whole document with `replace_schema` would silently freeze its other fields at
today's dump.

## Generator pipeline

1. Parse the selected source into the IR in `src/ir.rs`.
2. Analyze containers and codec arguments in `src/generator/resolver.rs`.
3. Optionally emit the structured wire manifest from the fully lowered IR.
4. Emit `proto.rs`, `types.rs`, `mcpe.rs`, `common.rs`, `borrowed.rs`, and the
   version crate manifest.
5. Register canonical definitions for reuse among versions generated in the
   same invocation.

The retained unit tests cover the parser, lowering, corrections, and manifest
shape. The real-docs regeneration and protocolgen parity gate is exposed by
`scripts/axolotl-parity.sh` at the protocolgen repository root.

## Common commands

```bash
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- --source mojang --latest --output-dir /tmp/valentine-mojang
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- --source mojang --versions 1.26.40 --proto --output-dir /tmp/valentine-mojang
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- --source endstone --latest --output-dir /tmp/valentine-endstone
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- --source mojang --list-versions --output-dir /tmp/valentine-mojang
cargo run -p valentine_gen -- --source mojang --latest --log debug --output-dir /tmp/valentine-mojang
```

When behavior must survive regeneration, change the parser, IR analysis, or
emitter rather than generated Rust.
